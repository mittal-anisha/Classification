# Classification

## Project 1
The database consists of the multi-spectral values of pixels in 3x3 neighborhoods in a satellite image and the classification associated with the central pixel in each neighborhood. 
The aim is to predict this classification, given the multi-spectral values.
Classification tree and Multinomial logistic regression were fitted to the data and the model with the highest accuracy is selected. 

## Project 2
The given data contains 983 mid-infrared (MIR) spectra collected from different authenticated fruit purees. The purees are either obtained from pure strawberries or adulterated strawberries and/or other black and red colored fruits. The sample spectra are thus assigned to one of two classes: strawberry and nonstrawberry. The spectra were acquired from each puree using attenuated total reluctance sampling, with the acquisition order randomized concerning the sample type. The spectra are measured over 47 wavelengths. 
The task is to predict whether a sample is a strawberry/non-strawberry puree based on the MIR data for food authenticity recognition.
Random forest, boosting, and Support Vector Machine models were fitted to the data and the model with the highest accuracy is selected.
